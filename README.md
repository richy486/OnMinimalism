On Minimalism
============

A game made for Ludum Dare 26 (April 2013)

Move the dot with the arrow keys, avoid the stompers while working your way through the maze to find the treasure! 

The minimal aspect I went for was through the single pixel character, minimal colours with mostly greys and a single 'enemy' the stomper. 

I tried to use the stomper in as many ways as I could think of while keeping the mechanic the same. 

Built for OSX and Windows using cocos2d-x. 
Sounds made using bfxr
